So you want to try Linux? Good choice. Here's my no-bullshit guide to getting started.

## Choosing a Distro

Don't overthink it. Here's my recommendation:

- **Complete beginner?** → Linux Mint or Ubuntu
- **Want to learn?** → Fedora or openSUSE
- **Already comfortable?** → Arch, Debian, or whatever you want

## First Steps After Install

```bash
# Update everything first
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf upgrade -y                      # Fedora
sudo pacman -Syu                         # Arch

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install git curl vim htop neofetch
```

## Learn the Terminal

The terminal is your friend. Start with these:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `ls -la` | List files with details |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `pwd` | Print working directory |
| `cat` | Display file contents |
| `grep` | Search text patterns |
| `man` | Read the manual |
